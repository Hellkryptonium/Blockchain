BlockChain Project

A blockchain wallet is a digital tool that allows users to securely store, manage, and interact with cryptocurrencies or digital assets on a blockchain. It consists of two key components: a **private key** and a **public key**. The private key is a secret code that allows the wallet owner to access and manage their assets, while the public key, when transformed, generates the wallet address. The **wallet address** is a unique identifier, similar to a bank account number, that others can use to send funds to the wallet. This address is visible on the blockchain and represents the destination for transactions, but it does not reveal personal information about the owner.
